boardgamegeek - A Python API for boardgamegeek.com
==================================================


``boardgamegeek`` is a Python library which makes it easy to access data from `boardgamegeek.com <http://www.boardgamegeek.com>`_ using their official XML
API.

It is a fork of `boardgamegeek <https://github.com/lcosmin/boardgamegeek>`_ from Cosmin Luță,
which is an almost completely rewritten fork of libBGG_.
Several Features dont work correctly so they are being updated to be used with our Discord bot.
