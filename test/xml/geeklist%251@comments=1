<title>First 10 Games Added to BGG</title>
<description>These are the first 10 games that were added to the database back in January 2000.  These games are in the database in this order due to the old Metrogamers website reviews.  These were games reviewed by either Derk Solko or Neil Carr back in the day.

Sorry for not putting much in the way of descriptions.  This is pretty much a test list.</description>

Of course, the reason for this bizarre start is because of the session report which started it all off, http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewfullsession.php3?groupname=Metrogamers&amp;dateofsession=19990214 .  Ahh, back in the day.  When this database was still a glimmer in Aldie&#039;s eye.

Just noticed there are holes in the list, and about 1/2 way through the list, the list item numbers don&#039;t match the bgg game id... the following games are missing all together that have a game id &lt;= 10?  Or were 6 &amp; 8 actually added later?

Game id #6: [gameid=6]
Game id #8: [gameid=8]

First comment in 2015!!!!

Just stumbled upon this by going [i]humm, I wonder what the first geeklist is?[/i]  

Gotta say, the dates don&#039;t make any sense, and I&#039;m assuming that a couple old-timer&#039;s comments got deleted when they deleted their accounts.

Why where the dates messed with?  And when was this thing actually created?  It says 2006....can&#039;t be right.

Idle curiosity.....this is history! :p

Aldie created the first 5 entries in 2001.
Then he needed a short break, and finished the list in 2006.

Here from The Geek Weekly link from today.  Wow, a piece of history.

I still own 9 of these 10.  (Tal der Konige is the only one I never acquired.)  Several of these I probably got just because in the very early days I was scanning the games listed for something that looked interesting.  I wouldn&#039;t surprise me if I just started looking at game #1, but I had Dragonmaster and Cathedral from way before bgg.  Mare Mediterraneum seems for sure something I bought after seeing it here and being young and misdirected - I remember it being a pretty expensive purchase back in the day.  Beautiful game, but I never did play it and it still sits on a shelf taunting me.

They do sit flush with the table, if, and only if, you screw around with them for 5 or 10 minutes to make them do so. To a first approximation, if you make the middle part parallel to the parts two spaces either side, and then make the end bit parallel to the one next to the middle piece on that side, it should lie flush.

However, easier said than done.

Sweet box! Did not know about its BGG origins tho&#039; 

Unlike many actually played this a few times and it is still prominently displayed!

I always interpreted that to mean Can&#039;t Stop.  I guess must-own-ness is in the eye of the beholder.

I agree.  It was the game that got me into different gaming when I was a kid.  Before that, I played the more classic games of the day.  This was my first stock market game and my first bookcase game.  It led me into more strategic games.  It&#039;s still my favorite game.

This game was also my first &quot;adult&quot; game and really set the way for a life of gaming. My parents first encountered it at a games night with the folks they normally played bridge with. It was the first of many 3M games that came into the house, it went on camping trips, and it survived the many different moves that came with being a military family. I purchased my own copy when I left for college and was delighted to get the family&#039;s original copy when my parents were forced to downsize things when they moved to a much smaller home.

I&#039;ve read that Acquire inspired a lot of European designers, which kind of makes it the proto-Euro.

Ah, how true.
I bought the game exactly for the same reasons, and I&#039;m aching on the rulebook (living rules) to get a gripe on it.
Probably I&#039;ll never play it... :(

What does the phrase &quot;living rules&quot; mean?
Enlighten me!

&quot;Living rules&quot; refers to the idea of continuously rewriting an original (or older) document to reflect modern ideas and rules.  There are a lot of people who would like to do the same to the United States Constitution.

In other words, the rules for this game are constantly being updated to reflect new ideas and rules that were written for other games (or later for this game) but can be used to &quot;fix&quot; this game.

No, thats not it at all. &quot;Living rules&quot; is a term from the wargaming community.  It means - bearing in mind the complexity of those games - to fix errors and &quot;patch&quot; in new/modified rules to take care of obscure situations that have arisen in play.

I keep a copy of this set up next to my desk at work. One day, someone will ask about it and I’ll have them hooked.

I think you may have missed one... here #8 in GL, is game id #9...

#8 gameid is....

[gameid=8]

[-]or was 8 skipped and then that id given to that game?[/-]
ah I see... [gameid=8] (gameid #8) is #10 in the GL so just out of order from what I expected :)

Fascinating that this game was such an early addition to the database.  I have been championing this game as one of the most underappreciated games from that era.  It&#039;s what Carcassone for heavy gamers looks like.

What happened to the date?  

Is this a past shadow of a future projection in order to test the database structure (kind of like reading &quot;1984&quot; in 2006) or are we actually looking at a cheap reproduction of the original posting of RA to this GeekList?

Either way this is deeply suspicious--I recommend forming a committee to investigate!
